## Authors

[Stefano Saitta](https://github.com/stefanosaittamrf) && [Ã“scar Dominguez](https://github.com/dominguezcelada)

## Technology Used

We use [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/) for create and display this presentation with couple of hacks in order to version it and make it collaborative, because a git presentation that is not versioned with git is not worth that name :octocat:
